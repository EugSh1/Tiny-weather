# TinyWeather

TinyWeather is a minimalistic application for displaying the current weather in
the selected city. The app allows users to see the current weather conditions
conditions, including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and other
details. It does not provide a weather forecast (due to the limitations of the
free OpenWeather plan), which makes it ideal for quick information about current
conditions.

    name and get information for another city.
